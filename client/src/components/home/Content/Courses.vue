            At our school , we advance education through h4rogressive teaching
            and innovative research. Our courses are rigorously evaluated to
            ensure we offer both students and teachers the best possible
            experience with us. Student assessment is related to the real world,
            and provides evidence of learning achievement. Through the
            evaluation of teaching, along with support and unit resources, we
            seek to improve learning and teaching outcomes.

          <h4>
            Shared educational philosophy There are innumerable approaches to
            education, and finding a school or preschool that matches one’s own
            perspective can create a positive, productive academic experience
            for your child. Whether you prefer the student-directed learning
            method of Montessori, or the arts-based curriculum of a Waldorf or
            Reggio Emilia-inspired school, choosing the right private school
            will not only allow students to thrive in a supportive environment
            and build independence, but also gain unique skills that fit their
            learning style. Parent Erin Craig states of her experience,
            "Montessori seems to be able to individualize the focus so it pulls
            out of them what it needs too."

            Development for today's and tomorrow's world Private schools go
            beyond offering the mandatory subjects required by provincial
            curriculum; they can offer students a wide range of specializations
            including arts programs, athletics, math, science. Private schools
            are responsible for producing many leaders in politics, business and
            society, with a history of adapting quickly to changes in technology
            and culture. And today, they are also sought by parents of kids with
            special needs such as behaviour (including troubled teen behaviour),
            learning, developmental, or physical disabilities.
