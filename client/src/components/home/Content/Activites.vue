              MUSIC my school strong music program gives every boy musical
              voice. The program opens boys' ears to music, its many genres,
              nuances and methods of creation, and gives them a lifelong gift of
              appreciation. Boys are offered a wealth of diverse opportunities
              to explore the kinesthetic, creative, collaborative, and
              just-plain-fun aspects of making music, mastering a musical
              instrument, collaborating with other students in a performance
              group, writing or arranging music for a vocal ensemble, or
              studying the development of Western music.

              THEATRE thrives at MY SCHOOL. Through dramatics, students
              forge a shared sense of purpose and become an indissoluble team as
              they work together to mount a production, from Lower School class
              pays to Middle School productions to one of five tri-school Upper
              School plays. Theatre is about much more than just story telling;
              and, it is also about much more than a celebration of the self and
              one's own abilities.
