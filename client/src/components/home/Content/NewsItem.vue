                      <h4>At My Schools, the safety of students and staff members is the
              first priority. With the World Health Organization declaring the
              COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak a pandemic, these are the measures
              the school division has in place to address this public health
              situation. Saskatoon Public Schools take its direction from the
              Saskatchewan Health Authority, and division staff have received
              regular updates on the situation. As of today (March 11), there
              are no confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Saskatchewan and public
              health officials state the risk remains low. The school division
              has a pandemic response plan and has already taken preventative
              measures. Caretaking staff were previously directed to prioritize
              sanitization in all schools. Focus is being given to sanitizing
              push-pull points and frequently touched surfaces such as door
              handles, water fountain buttons, desks, countertops, sinks, and
              taps. Schools have been asked to review hygiene practices with
              students and have shared posters highlighting proper hand washing
              for posting in all bathrooms. These posters and other hygiene
              information can be accessed at www.germsmart.ca. Parents and
              guardians are being asked to review the following hygiene
              practices with children: Practice proper coughing and sneezing
              etiquette (into the bend of your elbow); Wash your hands often
              with soap and water; if soap and water are not available, use an
              alcohol- based hand sanitizer; Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and
              mouth with unwashed hands; Avoid close contact with people who are
              sick; and, Don't share water bottles, band instruments, eating
              utensils, electronic devices, ear pods or food. As always, if a
              child is sick, parents and guardians are asked to keep the child
              home from school. Individuals who may have concerns about their
              health can call the provincial HealthLine at 811 for advice and
              support. Information and updates regarding COVID-19 are available
              on www.saskatchewan.ca/coronavirus Parents and guardians are asked
              to contact their school if they have questions.
