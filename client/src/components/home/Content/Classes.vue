            Private School Testing Private school testing policies vary widely
            in terms of standardized testing requirements. While the federal
            department of education requires students at public schools to take
            part in these tests, they aren't always required of private schools.
            Policies are set by each individual state's department of education.
            In general, public school students are much more likely to submit to
            annual testing than students who attend private schools. The U.S.
            Department of Education does require both public and private schools
            to submit to National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP)
            testing every four years. This test is given to students in fourth,
            eighth and 12th grades, and it's used to measure educational
            progress. Individual results aren't given to students, and only
            randomly selected schools are required to participate. Only about 10
            percent of all schools are subject to NAEP testing at any given
            time, and these schools are chosen randomly to generate
            statistically accurate results [source: Florida Department of
            Education]. While public schools must publish their NAEP test
            results, private schools are permitted to keep these results a
            secret. Some private schools may choose to publish these results as
            a marketing tool to draw new students or to enhance the school's
            image [source: Wilde]. Besides the NAEP tests, most public schools
            are also subject to state-level assessment tests. Private schools
            are not required to participate in these tests in most areas, but
            some may choose to take part for a variety of reasons, like
            developing a benchmark for comparing their students' test scores to
            those at other schools in the area. Parents of potential students
            may request these scores when deciding whether to send their
            children to the school. The scores can also be used as a powerful
            marketing tool, especially if the private school's students score
            much higher on these tests than students at area public schools. In
            general, though, private schools tend to shy away from standardized
            testing because it often conflicts with core values, such as
            promoting individuality and aiding multifaceted development. Many
            education professionals also argue that standardized testing as a
            whole is flawed, though this debate is ongoing. Even students at
            private schools that don't participate in standardized testing will
            likely find themselves facing the biggest test of all: the SAT. This
            exam tests a student's aptitude to succeed in college and is
            required by a majority of colleges prior to admission. For private
            school students, lack of experience with standardized testing can be
            a hindrance when it comes time to take the SAT, though private
            school students still tend to score better on the SAT than students
            from public schools. While private schools may choose to reject most
            standardized testing, some may reject traditional grading entirely.
            Many Montessori and Waldorf programs skip grading until the high
            school level, choosing to offer other types of feedback to help
            improve student performance. Rather than returning papers marked
            with red ink, teachers take note of a student's mistakes or weak
            areas. They can then work with the student to develop a plan for
            improving these areas in the future. For example, a child with
            spelling trouble may be geared toward activities that naturally
            improve spelling, including reading or educational games.
